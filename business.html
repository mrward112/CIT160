    <!--Business description-->
    <h1>
        Hilltop Farms Catering
    </h1>
    <p>Personally, I don't have any idea as to what business I would like to start. However, my mother has been trying to start a catering service for the local community. Her hope is to provide a catering service with a more homemade taste to it while maintaining a managable budget.</p>

    <h2>So? What stage is this business in?</h2>
    <p>This business has gone through multiple names and phases. Orginally it was called Kindred Spirits Catering before we moved to Idaho. Most recently a concept of a larger scale business has been thought of that would incorporate more than just food. Who knows what the future of this business idea will become?</p>
